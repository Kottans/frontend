When you're done with your challenge push your code to github repo and publish
it using gh-pages. _Add link to it to your main frontend tasks repo._

If you honestly finished all the previous steps than go ahead and share it with
others - send a message in gitter channel with the link to you repo and "@/all"
tag and the words "Weather APP - finished" and add link to repo with code of the
website.

## Weather app

Create a page with a weather cast.

As a user, I would like to:

* enter the name of a city and get the forecast for it;
* choose period of the forecast. As example: today, tomorrow, week, two weeks, etc;
* choose units — Celsius or Fahrenheit;
* have a list of favorite cities. By selecting favorite city from the list, I
  want to see forecast in it;
* have a list of recently viewed cities;
* see current city in the link in the address bar of the browser. If I open this
  link in the new window, website must show me weather in this city;
* see fancy icons for forecast and design. Usage of template absolutely
  acceptable.

You must support only last versions of major browsers — Chrome, Safari, FF,
Edge.

If you wish, you can support Internet Explorer, but this is not required. Same
story with mobile devices.

### Additional information: ###
- The exact list of forecast periods may vary from API which you choose for this task. Providing forecast not for week, but for five days totally acceptable.

### Materials which will help you:

* [Weather public API's](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis#weather) - _you can use one of this API for
  getting data for your website_;
* [URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) - you can use
  this for working with URL;
* [Manipulating the browser history](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) -
  you must know how to work with browser history.

If you feel that you can do a better job, you can use
[async/awaits](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-from-callbacks-to-async-await-1cc090ddad99),
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), make
good responsive/fluid/elastic/whatever design and other modern stuff.
