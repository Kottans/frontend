When you're done with your challenge push your code to github repo and publish
it using gh-pages. _Add link to it to your main frontend tasks repo._

If you honestly finished all the previous steps than go ahead and share it with
others - send a message in gitter channel with the link to you repo and "@/all"
tag and the words "Weather APP - finished" and add link to repo with code of the
website.

## Weather app

Create a page with a weather cast.

As a user I would like to:

* enter name of the city or it's postcode and get weather cast in this city
* choose period of the weather cast: today, tomorrow, week, two weeks
* choose units — Celsius or Fahrenheit
* have a list of favorite cities. By selecting favorite city from the list, I
  want to see weather cast in it
* have a list of recently viewed cities
* see current city in the link in the address bar of the browser. If I open this
  link in the new window, website must show me weather in this city
* see fancy icons for weather cast and design. Usage of template absolutely
  acceptable

You must support only last versions of major browsers — Chrome, Safari, FF,
Edge.

If you wish, you can support Internet Explorer, but this is not required. Same
story with mobile devices.

### Materials which will help you:

* [Weather API](http://openweathermap.org/api) - _you can use this API for
  getting data for your website_
* [URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) - you can use
  this for working with URL
* [Manipulating the browser history](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) -
  you must know how to work with browser history

If you feel that you can do a better job, you can use
[async/awaits](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-from-callbacks-to-async-await-1cc090ddad99),
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), make
good responsive/fluid/elastic/whatever design and other modern stuff.
