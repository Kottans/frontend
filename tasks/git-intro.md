# Git and GitHub

Get familiar with Git and GitHub.

 1. Finish the course [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)

    You may resort to subtitles/closed captions and
    to auto-translated subtitles in particular if you feel
    it would help you to master the video course better.

 2. Complete the following levels at [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/):
    - Main: Introduction Sequence
    - Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes

 3. Create repository named `kottans-frontend`.
    
 4. Make a screenshot of your finished lessons from (1), (2) and put the screenshot in `git_basics` folder in your kottans-frontend repo
 
 5. Create `README.md` for the repository.
 
 8. In your `kottans-frontend` repo README.md:
    - add header ## Git basics
    - embed the screenshot or add a link to the screenshot
    - list your reflections on all subtasks (what was new to you, what surprised you, what you intend to use in future)
    - Great job! Go ahead and share your progress with others – post a message in course channel: `Git Basics — #done` (or `Git Basics — #p2p_done` if you are p2p course student) and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
  
 9. Study Extra Materials below to improve your skills.
    If you feel it affects your overall course performance consider
    reverting to those later e.g. when you have all mandatory tasks completed.
