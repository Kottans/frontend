# Mastering Git and Github - intro stage

Get familiar with version control systems (VCS) in general and Git and GitHub in particular.

 1. [What is Version Control](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud123/)

 2. [GitHub & Collaboration](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud456)

Finish the courses (1) and (2) above.

After comleting the courses do the following:
 1. Create repository named `kottans-frontend`.

 2. Create `README.md` for the repository.

 3. Describe your impressions about learned materials.

 4. Send a pull-request to [Kottans/mock-repo][mock-repo] proposing a change.
    It could be anything (literally, *anything*). If you have found a typo in README - great!
    Take care to give your PR a meaningful name and description.

    **Please note, that your PR may not be reviewed quickly.**

1. Make screenshots of your finished lessons from (1) and (2)
   and put the screenshots in `task_git_intro` folder in
   your `kottans-frontend` repo.
1. In your `kottans-frontend` repo `README.md`:
   * add header `## Git intro`;
   * embed the screenshots or add links to the screenshots;
   * list your reflections on all subtasks
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_);
1. You did lot already! If you honestly finished all the previous steps then go ahead and share it with others – post a message in a [course channel][chat]:
   `Git Intro — #done` and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
1. Study Extra Materials below to improve your skills.
   If you feel it affects your overall course performance consider
   reverting to those later e.g. when you have all mandatory tasks completed.
1. You may skip Optional materials from this task (if any).
